# Direct Mapping of Some Problems to Ising Models with Three-Valued Coupling Coefficients

<!-- abstract

Last month, I was asked to suggest possible applications of coherent
Ising machines (CIMs) with 10 000 spins and 10 000 x 10 000
three-valued (-1, 0, and 1) coupling coefficients. The difficulty
comes from the fact that most hard problems worth solving cannot be
directly represented by using the three-valued coupling coefficients,
and indirect mapping (via max-cut, for example) may be inefficient in
general. In this talk, I explain a few problems for which direct
mapping to Ising models with three-valued coupling coefficients is
possible (Lucas, 2014).

# Exponential time?

* Exponential time: `$\mathrm{O}(2^{\mathrm{poly}(n)})\qquad$`  ex. `$2^n$`

* Sub-exponential time: `$\mathrm{O}(2^{\mathrm{o}(n)})\quad$`  ex. `$2^\sqrt{n}$`

* Any NP problem can be solved *at most* exponential time.

  * NP `$\subseteq$` PSPACE `$\subseteq$` EXPTIME

* 3-SAT problem is believed to require **exponential time**.

  * Exponential time hypothesis (ETH) 
([Impagliazzo & Paturi, 1999](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCC.1999.766282))

* For some other NP-complete problems,  **sub-exponential time** algorithms are known.

  * ex.) Hamiltonian cycle problem on planar graphs
([Deineko, et al., 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orl.2005.04.013))

# Ising model

<img src="figs/fig09.png" width=60%>

* Spins: `$s_i\in\{1,-1\}$`

* Hamiltonian

  `$\displaystyle H = -\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} s_i s_j - \sum_i h_i s_i.$`

* Finding a ground state (minimum energy state) of an Ising model is
**NP-hard** 
([Barahona, 1982](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/15/10/028)).


---
# Alternative representation

* Spins: `$x_i\in\{0,1\}$`

* QUBO (Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization)

  `$\displaystyle H = \sum_{i,j}Q_{ij} x_i x_j.$`

* Since `$x_i=x_i^2$`, we can include the effect of the external
field into the weights of self-loops `$Q_{ii}$`.

* The two representations, based on {-1,1}-spins and {0,1}-spins, can
be **mutually transformed into each other** by the relation `$s_i = 2 x_i- 1$`.

  .small[* Precisely, we need to add or subtract some constant, but
  this does not change the optimal configuration.]

# Conversion

* QUBO to Ising model

  `$\begin{align}J_{ij}&\leftarrow -Q_{ij},\\h_i&\leftarrow -\sum_k(Q_{ik}+Q_{ki}).\end{align}$`

* Ising model to QUBO

  `$\displaystyle Q_{ij}\leftarrow -J_{ij}+\frac{\delta_{ij}}{2}\left(\sum_k(J_{ik}+J_{ki})-h_i\right).$`

# Constraints on coupling coefficients

* On November 13th, Prof. Aihara asked some of us to suggest possible
applications of CIMs with each of the following four conditions:

# Purpose

* Fortunately, I found a nice review that describes how to map many
famous NP or NP-hard problems to Ising models ([Lucas,
2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005)).

* Among the listed problems, I found some can be represented even if
`$J_{ij}\in \{-1,0,1\}$`.

* In this talk, I will introduce three problems which also have tight
relation to real-world applications.

  * **Graph coloring problem**

  * **Graph isomorphism problem**

  * **Maximum clique problem**

# Graph coloring problem

* Question: "Can we color *n*-vertices with *k*-colors such that all adjacent vertices are colored differently?"

<img src="figs/fig01.png" width=40%>

* NP-complete

* Planar graphs are always colorable by four colors.

* Related problem "what is the minimum number of colors?" (NP-hard)
is difficult to directly map to the restricted CIMs.

* Applications: register allocation
([Chaitin, 1982](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/872726.806984)), 
flight level allocation 
([Barnier & Brisset, 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:ANOR.0000032574.01332.98)), etc.

# Preliminaries

* Spin representing vertex *i* is assigned color *c*: `$x_{i,c}\in\{0,1\}$`

# Mapping

* Hamiltonian
([Lucas, 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005); 
[Rieffel, et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11128-014-0892-x))

  `$\displaystyle H = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}\right)^2 + \sum_{i<j}\sum_{c=1}^k a_{ij} x_{i,c}x_{j,c}$`.

* The 1st term represents the constraint that all vertices are assigned exactly 1 color.

* The 2nd term represents the constraint that if two nodes are connected, we cannot give the same color to them.

* If `$H=0$` is achieved, we know the graph is *k*-colorable.

---
# Expansion

* The 1st term

  `$\begin{align}H_1 &= \sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}\right)^2,\\&=\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-2\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}+\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}\sum_{d=1}^k x_{i,d}\right),\\&=\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-2\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}x_{i,c}+\sum_{c=1}^k \sum_{d=1}^k x_{i,c}x_{i,d}\right),\\&=\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1-\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}x_{i,c}+\sum_{c\neq d} x_{i,c}x_{i,d}\right).\end{align}$`

* Self-loop weights are -1, and weights between spins for the same vertex and different colors are 1.

<!--
  `$\displaystyle H=n-\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{c=1}^k x_{i,c}x_{i,c}+\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{c\neq d}x_{i,c}x_{i,d}+\sum_{i<j}\sum_{c=1}^k a_{ij} x_{i,c}x_{j,c}$`.

# Graph isomorphism problem

* Question: "Are two graphs topologically the same?"

<img src="figs/fig03.png" width=40%>

* This belongs to NP. NP-completeness is not known.

* Last month, it was claimed that a **quasi-polynomial time** algorithm exists
([Babai, 2015](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/quasipoly.html)).

# Preliminaries

* Spin representing the mapping from vertex *i* of the original graph
to vertex *u* of the target graph: `$x_{u,i}\in\{0,1\}$`

* Number of spins: `$n^2$` 

  * *n* is  the number of vertices.

  * This is the worst case. In most cases, it can be reduced to
`$n\log_2(n)$`
([Zick, et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep11168)).

* Original graph's adjacency matrix: `$A=\{a_{ij}\}$`

* Target graph's adjacency matrix: `$B=\{b_{uv}\}$`


---
# Mapping

* Hamiltonian
([Zick, et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep11168))

  `$\begin{align} H =& \sum_u\left(1-\sum_i x_{u,i}\right)^2+\sum_i\left(1-\sum_u x_{u,i}\right)^2\\&+\sum_{i,j,u,v, i\neq j}(1-a_{ij})b_{uv}x_{u,i}x_{v,j}+\sum_{i,j,u,v, u\neq v}a_{ij}(1-b_{uv})x_{u,i}x_{v,j}.\end{align}$`


* The 1st and 2nd terms represent the constraint that mapping is one-to-one.

* The 3rd term represents the constraint that if two nodes are not
connected at the original graph, they cannot be connected at the
target graph as well. 

* The 4th term is similar.

* If `$H=0$` is achieved, we know the two graphs are isomorphic.

---
# Expansion

* The 1st term

  `$\begin{align}H_1 &= \sum_u \left(1-\sum_i x_{u,i}\right)^2,\\&=\sum_u \left(1-2\sum_i x_{u,i}+\sum_i x_{u,i}\sum_j x_{u,j}\right),\\&=\sum_u \left(1-2\sum_i x_{u,i}x_{u,i}+\sum_i \sum_j x_{u,i}x_{u,j}\right),\\&=\sum_u \left(1-\sum_i x_{u,i}x_{u,i}+\sum_{i \neq j} x_{u,i}x_{u,j}\right).\end{align}$`

* Self-loop weights are -1, and weights between spins for the same
target vertex and different original vertices are 1.

* After adding the 2nd term, self-loop weights become -2.


---
# Transformation

* Weight matrix

  * Diagonal elements: -2

  * Non-diagonal elements: 0 or 1

  * Symmetric

* Transformation to make the weight matrix three-valued 
([Zick, et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep11168)):

  * Reduce diagonal elements to half.

  * Keep only one side of non-diagonal elements and all values on the
  other side are reset to 0.

---- 

.small[In fact, the mapping is still valid even if 
both sides of non-diagonal elements are retained
and only the diagonal elements are halved.]

# Maximum clique problem

* Question: "What is the maximum subgraph in which every pair
of nodes is connected?"

<img src="figs/fig05.png" width=40%>

(NP-complete) can be answered by solving the optimization problem.

# Applications

* Determination of lower-bound for graph coloring problem

* Protein structure alignment
([Strickland, et al., 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1040.0189), 
[Zhu and Weng, 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.20331), 
[Malod-Dognin, et al., 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-13193-6_10))

----

* Note that the notion of *clique* is usually too stringent for
community detection in practice.


---
# Equivalent problems

* Maximum clique problem is essentially equivalent to:

  * **Maximum independent set (MIS)**

  * **Minimum vertex cover**

  * **Maximum set packing**

* Also, **3-SAT** with *m*-clause can be mapped to MIS with *3m* vertices
([Lucas, 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005)).

# Mapping

* Spin representing vertex *i*: `$x_i\in\{0,1\}$`

* Number of spins = Number of vertices (*n*)

* Adjacency matrix: `$A=\{a_{ij}\}$`

* Hamiltonian 
([Lucas, 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005))

  `$\displaystyle H = \sum_{i\neq j}(1-a_{ij}) x_i x_j-\sum_i x_i.$`

* The 1st term represents the constraint that we cannot select node
pairs which are not connected.

* The 2nd term represents the objective that we are trying to select
as many nodes as possible.


---
# Is the constraint always satisfied?

* Hamiltonian

  `$\displaystyle H = \sum_{i\neq j}(1-a_{ij}) x_i x_j-\sum_i x_i.$`

* Assume that a pair of spins violate the constraint. Then, if we
change one of them from 1 to 0, following occurs.

  * The 2nd term increases by 1.

  * The 1st term decreases by at least 2 because of the symmetry with
  respect to switching *i* and *j*.

  * In total, the energy decreases.
  
* Therefore, any configuration that fails to satisfy the constraint cannot 
be a minimum energy state.

* **Weight decomposition** method

  * Proposed by Prof. Kawarabayashi

  * Numerically tested by Mr. Haribara

<!--

  * Real-valued weights (*k*-bit) are decomposed into *k* components. 

  * CIMs use one component at a time, and switch them periodically.

# Future works

* Prof. Yamamoto recommended to focus on **graph coloring problem**
and pointed out that we need to know more about:

  * Status of state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms

  * Problem size required in real-world applications

# Mapping from 3-SAT to MIS

* 3-SAT: `$\Psi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=C_1\wedge\ldots\wedge C_m$`

  * ex.) `$\Psi=(x_1\vee x_2\vee x_3)\wedge(x_1\vee \overline x_2\vee x_4)\wedge(x_2\vee x_3\vee \overline x_4)$`

* Conversion

  1. Convert clauses to triangles.

  2. Add links between contradicting (`$x_i$` and `$\overline x_i$`) literals.

<img src="figs/fig12.png" width=80%>


---
# 3-SAT and MIS

* 3-SAT solution exists => MIS solution of size *m* exists

  * Keep 1 literal in each triangle and remove others.

* MIS solution of size *m* exists => 3-SAT solution exists

  * Select all nodes whose literals appear in MIS solution at least
  once. Select `$x_i$` if neither `$x_i$` nor `$\overline x_i$`
  appears.

<img src="figs/fig13.png" width=60%>

# Many-body interaction

* If we are allowed to use real-valued coupling coefficients,
**many-body interaction** can be implemented by adding auxiliary spins
([Perdomo-Ortiz, et al., 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep00571)).

* For example, if the Hamiltonian contains a term `$x_1x_2x_3$`, where
`$x_i\in\{0,1\}$`, add **a new variable `$y\in\{0,1\}$`** and replace
the term with `$yx_3$`.

* This is safe as long as `$y=x_1x_2$`. To achieve this, **penalty
term *E* ** should be added to the Hamiltonian.

  `$E = c(3y+x_1x_2-2yx_1-2yx_2)$`.

  where `$c>0$` is a parameter. We can see that `$E=0$` for
  `$y=x_1x_2$` and `$E>c$` for `$y\neq x_1x_2$`.

* By using this technique, 3-SAT with *n*-variables and *m*-clauses
can be mapped to QUBO with *n*+*m* spins.

# Application of Max-cut

* VLSI design
([Barahona, et al., 1988](http://www.jstor.org/stable/170992)).

  * Crossing wires must be assigned to different layers.

  * By optimally assigning components to each layer, we want to
  minimize the number of via holes.

  * This problem can be mapped to Max-cut problems having both positive and negative weights.

# In-phase and quadrature

* Reference signal: `$\sin(x)$`

* Phase- and amplitude-modulated  signal:

  `$\begin{align}A\sin(x+\phi) &= A\sin(x)\cos(\phi)+A\cos(x)\sin(\phi),\\&=I\sin(x)+Q\cos(x).\end{align}$`

  * In-phase component: `$I\sin(x)$`

  * quadrature component: `$Q\cos(x)$`

# Quantum annealing and AQC

* **Quantum annealing**
([Kadowaki and Nishimori, 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.58.5355))

  `$H(t)=H_P + \Gamma(t)H_T.$`

  * `$H_P$`: Hamiltonian associated with the problem

  * `$H_T$`: Transverse field

  * `$\Gamma(t)$`: Amplitude of `$H_T$` that is gradually decreasing

* **Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC)**
([Farhi, et al., 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1057726))

  `$H(t)=\left(1-\frac{t}{T}\right)H_0 + \frac{t}{T}H_P.$`

  * `$H_0$`: Initial Hamiltonian

  * `$T$`: Total running time

  * *Adiabatic theorem* gives the necessary length of `$T$` for
  certainly finding an optimal solution.

# Simple coloring

* A graph *G* having maximum degree `$\Delta$` is `$\Delta+1$`-colorable.

  1. Select a vertex `$v$`.
  
  2. Repeatedly select a vertex from the remaining that is adjacent to
  any vertex previously selected.

  3. Assign colors to the vertices in the opposite order (lastly selected
  one is firstly colored). **This requires only `$\Delta$`colors** except
  `$v$`.

      * In each step, at least one neighbor is uncolored.

      * Thus, at most `$\Delta-1$` neighbors are colored.

  4. At last, if `$v$` has unfortunately `$\Delta$` neighbors and all
  are differently colored, assign a new color to it.

* The last point determines whether G is `$\Delta$`-colorable.

# Brooks' theorem

* A graph *G* having maximum degree `$\Delta$` is `$\Delta$`-colorable
unless it is a complete graph or a cycle graph of odd length.

# Interval graph coloring

* Interval graphs can be optimally colored in polynomial time.

* Algorithm is simple. Just sort the intervals according to their
*start* time, and assign colors to the intervals from the beginning.

# MIS and related problems

* Maximum independent set  (MIS)

  * Question: "What is the maximum size of node subset among which no edge exists?"

* Minimum vertex cover

  * Question: "What is the minimum size of node subset that contains at least one endpoint of every edge?"

* Maximum set packing 

  * `$U$`: Set of all items

  * `$S_i\subseteq U$`: Subsets of items

  * Question: "What is the maximum number of subsets in which no item is selected more than once?"

# MIS and MVC

* Maximum independent set (MIS) problem and minimum vertex cover (MVC)
problem are essentially equivalent.

* Intuitively, this can be seen from the following lemma:

 *"For any vertex cover (not necessarily minimum), its complement
vertex set is independent."*

  * By definition, the cover set contains at least one endpoint of every edge.

  * Assume that an edge exists between vertices in the complement set. 

  * If so, both of the endpoints are not in the cover set, resulting in contradiction.

  * Thus, the complement set is independent.
